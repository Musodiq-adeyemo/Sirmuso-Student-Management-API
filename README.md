# PROJECT ENVIRONMENT: 
This project requires a virtual environment for the proper functioning of the project. This section gives a short demonstration of how to create a virtual environment(windows users) which is as follows:
## Step 1:
Open your system command prompt from your window search bar "search command prompt".

## Step 2 :
Make a directory to your desktop or any preferable location.
### Command: cd Desktop
## Step 3:
Install virtual environment if not installed before.
### Command: pip install virtual environment
## Step 4:
Create your flask environment with any name you want. (i will be using flaskenv for demonstration)
### Command: virtualenv flaskenv
## Step 5:
Make a directory to your environment
### Command: cd flaskenv
## Step 6:
Make a directory to scripts
### Command: cd scripts
## Step 7:
Activate your environment
### Command: activate
Yes, your environment is ready for use.
### Note: The above illustrations are for windows users only.

# INSTALLATION:
This section contains all the packages to be installed for this project.
Before installation make sure your environment is activated and packages are installed in the terminal( e.g command prompt, PowerShell, Git Bash, etc) using  "pip install package".
## Packages to be installed:
### flask
### flask-login
### flask-sqlalchemy
### flask-migrate
### flask-jwt-extended
### flask-restx
### python-decouple
### python-dotenv

# AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION
This student management API is fully authenticated using JWT tokens. The user will need an access token before they are allowed to get access to others routes. The users must first register their accounts and after registration, they are meant to log in to their accounts where an access token will be generated for every user. The access token is the gateway for every user to access other routes.
Sirmuso Student Management API is well-secured so that unauthorized users cannot access the unauthorized routes so it is advised that every users should follow the rules and guidelines stated below.
